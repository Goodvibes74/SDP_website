# Django Sales App Project Documentation
## README (Simple)

### Overview
    Django Sales App is a simple web application built with Django that allows users to manage sales listings. It includes pages for browsing sales, creating new sales entries, viewing a user dashboard, managing user profiles, and more. The design includes a navigation bar, a hero (jumbotron) section on the Home page, and a footer on all pages.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: Download the project code to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment (optional):
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
3. Install dependencies:
    pip install django
    (Alternatively, run pip install -r requirements.txt if a requirements file is provided.)
4. Apply database migrations:
    python manage.py migrate
5. Run the development server:
    python manage.py runserver

The application will start running at http://localhost:8000/.
